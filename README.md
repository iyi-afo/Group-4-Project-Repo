This Jupyter Notebook is a data-driven project designed to streamline the process of working with datasets. It guides the user through data extraction, transformation, and preparation, making it ideal for projects in data analysis, machine learning, or student performance tracking.

With a mix of clear markdown documentation and executable Python code, the notebook serves as both a learning tool and a practical workflow. Users can easily understand each step from importing data, cleaning and transforming it, to preparing it for deeper insights.

It’s not just code it’s a well-documented workflow that can be adapted for academic projects, business analytics, or personal learning in Python and data science.
